Here are the python scripts that were used for the analysis in the master's thesis, alongside plots of the results. AMPL.py and AMPX.py contains the amplitude for charm Λ and Ξ baryon respectively, both of which are built on additional formulas found in Form.py.

Tool_Normalisation.py was used to determine all the individual integrals found in Eq. (127) in the thesis.

Tool_MonteCarlo.py was used to generate the pseudodata.

Tool_Fitting was used to fit the pseudodata and extract the estimated values, uncertanties and covariance matrix.

The AmplitudeV2 directory contains the same amplitudes but in an alternative forms of the (starting from another differently orientated rest frame). The end result is still the same.
