Here are the python scripts that were used for the analysis in the master's thesis, alongside plots of the results. AMPL.py and AMPX.py contains the amplitude for charm Λ and Ξ baryon respectively, both of which are built on additional formulas found in Form.py.

Tool_Normalisation.py was used to determine all the individual integrals found in Eq. (127) in the thesis.

Tool_MonteCarlo.py was used to generate the pseudodata.

Tool_Fitting was used to fit the pseudodata and extract the estimated values, uncertanties and covariance matrix.
